# üèóÔ∏è Add Global Attributes to HTML Elements for Use With CSS

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to add global attributes to my HTML elements so that I can add styling with CSS.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the `<section>` elements are given a class attribute with a value of `lesson`.

* It's done when the email list item is given a unique attribute with a value of `email`.

* It's done when the GitHub list item is given a unique attribute with a value of `github`.

* It's done when the portfolio list item is given a unique attribute with a value of `portfolio`.

* It's done when the existing image's `src` attribute specifies the relative path to the `image-1.jpg` file found in the `assets` directory and the `alt` attribute describes the image.

* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup.

<!-- Done, Done, Done, Done, Done, Done, and Done!  -->
## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

![The portfolio page features headings in blue text, rounded corners on the image placeholder, and various background colors.](./assets/image-1.png)

## üí° Hints

Why is it important that each global attribute is given a unique name?

<!-- Because global attributes are usually generally multiple and if they were all labled the same, then one could not target a specific element in order to style using CSS or otherwise, because they would all be selected, it would change them all.  -->

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What other attributes can be used with HTML elements?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

<!-- Non-Global Attributes can be used with HTML elements, these other elements can only be used with specific elements. They include [alt, href, placeholder, src, and value, etc.]  -->
