# 📖 Use Command-Line Commands to Create Directory and File

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a developer, I want to use the command line to create a directory and file on my computer. 

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when a new directory named `first-day` has been created using command-line commands.

* It's done when the `first-day` directory contains a file named `index.html`. The file should also be created using command-line commands.

## 📝 Notes

Refer to the documentation: 

[MDN Web Docs on basic built-in terminal commands](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#Basic_built-in_terminal_commands)

<!-- The deed is Done!✅  -->

## 💡 Hints

What command can you use to list the contents of a directory? How can you use this command to check your work?

<!-- (ls) is the cmd in Bash to list the contents of the current directory. You can use this after you've moved a file into a directory, to make sure it is there. And check if you can access it. You can also use it to see if you have other directories beneath the current directory. -->

## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* Which command do you use to copy or move files?

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

<!-- You use the (cp) cmd to copy and move files to another directory. You can also use the (mv) cmd, but it will not only copy and move the file, but will also remove it from it's original place. Better to use cp unless you are planning to move it and remove entirely from a directory. -->
