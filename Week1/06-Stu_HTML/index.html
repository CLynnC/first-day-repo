      <p> Hello my name is Crystal Lynn. I also go by the name SiqChild in the video game world, because of my email being siqoya@yahoo.com and I have had a heck of a time copeing with my manic-like depression. I like my oatmeal chunky and my peanut butter smooth! I also enjoy the following: Coding, Cats, Crochet, Long walks through the park, Watching Dark Shadows on a stormy night, and reading books. I have soo many hobbies, I couldn't even begin to count them all. But if you want to get a hold of me, I'm sure we could find something in common. I am also a mother to the absolutely most adorable best baby boi in the WORLD, Alistair! And hope to be married someday soon. My biggest dream is to one day own our own home up north. I'm originally from Michigan, and so I miss the cold and the snow. I'm truly a penquin of sorts. And was raised a full goth. :-P  With Star Trek/Trekkie tendancies. [^_~*]  That's all you'll get from me here. Poo!üí©</p>
