# 🏗️ Create a Webpage Using HTML 

Work with a partner to implement the following user story:

* As a student, I want to create a biography page that includes an image, a paragraph about me, and my contact information.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when the main header reads "Student Bio". 

* It's done when there is a section that includes a name, an image, and a paragraph.

* It's done when there is a second section that includes a subheader labeled "Contact Info" and a list that includes links to my email, GitHub, and portfolio.

* It's done when the finished page matches the mockup. 

## Assets

The following image demonstrates the web application's appearance and functionality:

## 💡 Hints

How can you use header elements to define the most important heading and the subheaders? How will using different header elements impact the size of the text?

Refer to the [Full-Stack Blog HTML Cheatsheet](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/html/html-cheatsheet)

<!-- You can do this by using the h1-6 header tags. Those tags will enlarge and emphasize the various headings on which they tag, from the largest being h1 all the way to the smallest, but still noteable h6! -->
## 🏆 Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* What are the advantages of using semantic elements in your HTML? 

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.

<!-- These elements make it easier for other coders, if working in a team, to tell what goes where and what it probably pertains to. It aids greatly in handling the CSS code when the site is finished set up and ready to be styled. -->
