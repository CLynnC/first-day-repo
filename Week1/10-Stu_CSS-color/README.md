## üí° Hints

How can we use the `<link>` element inside the `<head>` to connect the HTML to the CSS?

<!-- This <link rel> line allows us to link a stylesheet straight into the HTML, which would then be used by the browser to style it. And you normally put it within the <head> section of an HTML doc.  -->

## üèÜ Bonus

If you have completed this activity, work through the following challenge with your partner to further your knowledge:

* How can we use color to help make your website accessible to users? What color combinations should be avoided? 

<!-- In order to make a website more accessable to a user, you can use special coloring templates and add accessability options for those with special sight needs. Such as a color blind mode, or dark mode for those who have trouble with bright colors. Also, you would want to avoid the colors we used mainly in this excercise. The bright normal colors that are highly contrasting, can irritate a user's eyes, accessably or not. -->

Use [Google](https://www.google.com) or another search engine to research this.
